A simple Todo App for learning the basic principles of Vue

Things I've learned so far, in order of difficulty:

- Installing VueJS globally;
- Creating a project with ```vue create vue-learning```;
- The folder structure of a vue app;
- The file structure of a component (template, script, style);
- Fuelling the app components with dummy data (i.e. an array of todo items);
- displaying a list of components (v-for);
- passing props to components;
- creating a new todo using events (this.$emit);
- exchanging events between components which are more distant than parent/child (tricky with Vue3 -> tiny-emitter to the rescue!);
- ...

Future topics:
- adding style to components (maybe with tailwind-css);
- increase knowledge on event handling between components;
- ...
